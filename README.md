Python - Recommender system on implicit feedback for recommending products to users
I have given the data set to be loaded in the code by the name 'newdata.csv'

'result.csv' include the solution csv file : It contains all the customer IDs and in the next columns contain 10 best ProductIDs that should be recommended to him

read the files provided in the following order > report>pseudo code > code > result

in code.py the final result is : top 10 products that should be recommended to the the customer ID - 21
you can change that by changing 21 by any other customer ID
